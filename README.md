A modern web reading app

## Why deprecated

I have constantly devoted many of my time into this project since 2015, for the purpose of learning all kinds of practical technologies. But now it's time to focus on other fields that interests me more like machine learning. I've been struggling with this. And tried to save the project. However, it's always too time-consuming to make a good product, and I have no tolerance with imperfect products. Instead of wasting time maintaining, I decided to let it go.

Through all these efforts I've made with this project, I've extracted some of my code from this project into packages to serve elsewhere. Some I've also published to npm.

These packages are:

- [wparcel](https://github.com/gaoxiaoliangz/wparcel)
- [epub-parser](https://github.com/gaoxiaoliangz/epub-parser)
- ~~[react-atom-components](https://github.com/gaoxiaoliangz/react-atom-components)~~
- ~~[universal-react-starter](https://github.com/gaoxiaoliangz/universal-react-starter)~~
